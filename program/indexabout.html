      <p class="creator-desc">Amy Hutton grew up in Peoria, Arizona with her parents and sister. She has always had a passion for design and at a young age knew her career would be somewhere in the arts. Amy began attending Arizona State University in Fall 2019 and has thrived there ever since. She has had the opportunity to meet some amazing professors and learn more about design. Amy continues to have a drive for design and hope one day her design degree can lead to a position at Disney.</p>
      <p class="quote">"Creating the program book was a project I had been looking forward too since freshman year of the program. I worked really hard on not only the book but this website as well" - Amy Hutton</p>
